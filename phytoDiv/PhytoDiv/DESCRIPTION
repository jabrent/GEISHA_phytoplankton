Description: The PhytoDiv package contains functions designed to facilitate the 
    assignment of morpho-functional group (MFG) classifications to phytoplankton
    species based on a combination of taxonomy (Class,Order) and a suite of 7 
    binomial functional traits. MFG classifications are derived from 
	Salmaso et al. 2015, DOI:10.1111/fwb.12520. That reference should be cited 
	when using the package. The PhytoDiv package is a product of the GEISHA 
	(Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on freshwater Habitat and 
	Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB (the Centre 
	for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell
	Center, with data and other support provided by members of GLEON (the Global
	Lake Ecology Observation Network).This software is preliminary or provisional
	and is subject to revision. It is being provided to meet the need for timely
	best science. The software has not received final approval by the U.S. 
	Geological Survey (USGS). No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the 
	USGS or the U.S. Government as to the functionality of the software and
