Description: Functions that facilitate the use of accepted taxonomic nomenclature, collection of
	functional trait data, and assignment of functional group classifications to phytoplankton
	species. Possible classifications include Morpho-functional group (MFG; Salmaso et al. 2015 <doi>)
	and CSR (Reynolds 1988 <doi>) Classifications can be based on user-supplied trait data, a published
	trait database for 1222 freshwater European taxa, or a library of literature-derived MFG classifications
	for common freshwater species.The algaeClassify package is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts
    of Storms on freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB 
    (Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for
	Synthesis and Analysis, 
    with data and other support provided by members of GLEON (Global Lake Ecology Observation 
    Network). This software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision. It is being
