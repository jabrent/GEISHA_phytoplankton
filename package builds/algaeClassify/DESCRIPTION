Description: The algaeClassify package contains functions designed to facilitate the assignment 
	of morpho-functional group (MFG) classifications to phytoplankton species based on a 
	combination of taxonomy (Class,Order) and a suite of 7 binomial functional traits. MFG 
	classifications are derived from Salmaso, Nico, Luigi Naselli-Flores, and Judit Padisak. 
	"Functional classifications and their application in phytoplankton ecology." Freshwater Biology 
	60.4 (2015): 603-619, and this reference should be cited when using the package. The 
	algaeClassify package is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on 
	freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB 
	(the Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center,
	with data and other support provided by members of GLEON (the Global Lake Ecology 
	Observation Network). This	software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision.
