The required traits are flagella (presence/absence), size (large/small), colonial (true/false), filament (filamentous growth form (true/false)), centric growth form (true/false/NA if not diatoms), gelatinous sheath (present/absent), aerotopes(present/absent). Trait values should be coded as numeric 1 (present/true) or 0 (absent/false), except for size, which can be 'large' or 'small'. The classification of phytoplankton as large or small is left to the user, to be determined based on their study system. MFG classifications are derived from Salmaso, Nico, Luigi Naselli-Flores, and Judit Padisak. \"Functional classifications and their application in phytoplankton ecology.\" Freshwater Biology 60.4 (2015): 603-619, and this reference should be cited when using the pacakge. The PhytoDiv package is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB (the Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center, with data and other support provided by members of GLEON (the Global Lake Ecology Observation Network).This software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision.
