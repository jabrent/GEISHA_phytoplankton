Description: The PhytoDiv package contains functions designed to facilitate the assignment of morpho-functional group (MFG) classifications to phytoplankton species based on a combination of taxonomy (Class,Order) and a suite of 7 binomial functional traits. The required traits are flagella (presence/absence), size (large/small), colonial (true/false), filament (filamentous growth form (true/false)), centric growth form (true/false/NA if not diatoms), gelatinous sheath (present/absent), aerotopes(present/absent). Trait values should be coded as numeric 1 (present/true) or 0 (absent/false), except for size, which can be 'large' or 'small'. The classification of phytoplankton as large or small is left to the user, to be determined based on their study system. MFG classifications are derived from Salmaso, Nico, Luigi Naselli-Flores, and Judit Padisak. "Functional classifications and their application in phytoplankton ecology."

The PhytoDiv package is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB (the Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center, with data and other support provided by members of GLEON (the Global Lake Ecology Observation Network).This software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision.
