function list

export(accum) - species accumulation curves vs. simulated curves
export(algae_search) - checks names against algaebase online database, returns matches, also higher taxonomy
export(bestmatch) - internal function for improving algae_search
export(date_mat) - transposing timeseries phytoplankton abundance into presence absence or abundance matrices for ordination
export(genus_species_extract) - extract clean genus, species, and subspecies names from a list of binomial names- cleans up abbreviations, prefixes, and suffixes
export(phyto_ts_aggregate) - wrapper for aggregate, to assist in creating aggregate timeseries of abundance based on multiple grouping variables - genus/family/order, sampling station, etc.
export(sampeff) - ??
export(species_to_mfg) - shouldn't be in this version.
export(species_to_mfg_df) - shouldn't be in this version.
export(spp_list_algaebase)- wrapper for algae_search function applied to whole dataset
export(traits_to_csr) -  assign CSR to phytoplankton based on trait measurements (surface/volume ratio and maximum linear dimension) and criteria defined by Colin REynold (Reynolds 1988, Reynolds 2006)
export(traits_to_csr_df) - wrapper for traits_to_csr
export(traits_to_mfg) - assign morphofunctional groups based on binary trait values and criteria defined in Salmaso et al. 2015.
export(traits_to_mfg_df) - wrapper for traits_to_mfg_df.
